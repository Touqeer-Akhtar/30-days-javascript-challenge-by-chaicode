A code repo for javascript challenge from chaicode

## Day 1 - Variables and Data Types

1. Read about variables and how to declare it using **let var const**.
2. Read about **typeof** keyword.
3. Did some basic questions.


## Day 2 - Operators

2. **Assignment operators**: +=, -=
3. **Comparison operators**: >, <
4. **Logical operators**: &&, ||, !
5. **Ternary operator**:

## Day 3 - Control Structures

1. Did some questions on if-else, nested if-else, ternary operator, **Switch Case**

2. What I learned?
    - I got to know that, I **didn't knew** about **switch cases** that much.
    In task 5th where I had to assign grades according to their score, I found that...
        - **We can't declare ranges in switch case** without using a function as The switch statement performs strict equality checks (===) against the expression provided.
        - I took little bit of help from internet to understand more and made a **function for switch case** (Task 5)

3. Task 7 about *creating program to check* **Leap Year** was bit hard but eventually I got it.


## Day 4 - Loops

1. Did questions based on **for, while, do-while loops**.

2. **Something New!**
    - I got to know about **Continue** statement in loops and we can use **Break** statement in loops as well (task 8, 9).


## Day 5 - Functions

1. Did questions based on Functions like :- 
- function declaration
- function expression
- arrow functions
- functions with default value
- high-order functions


## Day 6 - Array

1. Did questions based on Arrays :- 
- Array creation and access
- Array methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, **map, filter, reduce**
- **Multi-dimensional Array** and accessing specific element
```arr[i][j]``` where i is the index of inside array(in which element is) and then j is the index of the element (task 13).


## Day 7 - Objects

1. Creating and accessing objects
2. Object properties(variables) and methods(functions)
3. Nested Object
4. **this** keyword in object
5. Accessing all keys and value of an object through **Object.keys(<-objName->)** and **Object.values(<-objName->)**

## Day 8 - ES6+ Features

- Template Literals, Destructuring, Default parameters
- Spread and Rest Operators
