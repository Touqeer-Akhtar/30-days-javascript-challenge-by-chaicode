A code repo for javascript challenge from chaicode

## Day 1 - Variables and Data Types

## Day 3 - Control Structures

1. Did some questions on if-else, nested if-else, ternary operator, **Switch Case**

2. What I learned?
    - I got to know that, I **didn't knew** about **switch cases** that much.
    In task 5th where I had to assign grades according to their score, I found that...
        - **We can't declare ranges in switch case** without using a function as The switch statement performs strict equality checks (===) against the expression provided.
        - I took little bit of help from internet to understand more and made a **function for switch case** (Task 5)

3. Task 7 about *creating program to check* **Leap Year** was bit hard but eventually I got it.
